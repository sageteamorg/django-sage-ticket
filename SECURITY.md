# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please do the following:

1. **Do not open a public issue.** This could allow the vulnerability to be exploited before it is fixed.

2. **Email us directly at** `security@sageteam.org`. Include the following information in your email:
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability (proof-of-concept code is preferred).
   - Potential impact of the vulnerability.
   - Any possible mitigations you have identified.

3. **Give us a reasonable amount of time to respond.** We aim to acknowledge your email within 48 hours and will send regular updates on our progress.

4. **Coordinate disclosure.** Once the vulnerability is fixed, we will coordinate with you on the disclosure process. We would appreciate it if you give us a chance to release a patch and announce the vulnerability before you publish any details.

## Security Measures

To ensure the security of our project, we follow these practices:

- Regularly update dependencies to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
- Use static analysis tools to detect potential security issues.
- Conduct regular code reviews with a focus on security.
- Maintain a secure environment for our infrastructure.
